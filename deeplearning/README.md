#Deep learning

There were 3 assignements to achieve:

**MP1**:

It was about linear classifier, convolutional neural network and hourglass network. There were 3 
problems:
1) Given a set of images predicting whether it's a triangle, a rectangle or a circle.
2) Given a set of triangle, predicting its vertices.
3) Given a set of noisy images, denoising them. 

Results:
1) Accuracy of 94%
2) Not results
3) Accuracy of 99.5%
